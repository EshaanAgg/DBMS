# DBMS

This repository contains all my scripts and implementations that I made as a part of the Database Management System course.

## Contents

- [scripts](./scripts/) directory hosts the Python files that I used to generate data and populate data in my local MySQL instance for the lab assignments.
- [hashing](./hashing/) contains my implementation of the [Extendible Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extendible_hashing) algorithm in C++.
