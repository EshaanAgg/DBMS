# Hasher

This is an implemenation of the Extendible Hashing algorithm using OOPS.

- You can compile the [`Hashing.cpp`](./Hashing.cpp) program using any CPP compiler with the support for the `bits/srdc++.h` header file.
- The `Hash` class crates an instance of the extendible hasher, and exports some pubic methods which can be used to cutomise the behaviour of the hashing output (dubugging).
- You can start the interactive shell with the `REPL` method on the same.
- The debugging output shows the complete directory and all the buckets in a nice and well padded and adjusted tabular view to ensure the sanity of the program
